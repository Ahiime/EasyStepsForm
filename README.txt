== Description ==

This multistep form plugin simplifies the creation of multi-stage forms, providing users with a smooth and guided experience. Designed for easy integration and high customizability, it allows adding progressive form sections with clear steps, saving user responses at each step and validating input in real-time. Ideal for registration forms, surveys, payment processes, and any other multi-step workflows, this plugin is straightforward to set up and supports intuitive navigation with Next and Previous buttons, progress indicators, and customization options for each step.

For backwards compatibility, if this section is missing, the full length of the short description will be used, and
Markdown parsed.

A few notes about the sections above:

*   "Contributors" is a comma separated list of wp.org/wp-plugins.org usernames
*   "Tags" is a comma separated list of tags that apply to the plugin
*   "Requires at least" is the lowest version that the plugin will work on
*   "Tested up to" is the highest version that you've *successfully used to test the plugin*. Note that it might work on
higher versions... this is just the highest one you've verified.
*   Stable tag should indicate the Subversion "tag" of the latest stable version, or "trunk," if you use `/trunk/` for
stable.

the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets

(or jpg, jpeg, gif).

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
